## Usage


To compile:

```shell
make
```
```shell
./minishell
```

To run the program:

```shell
./minishell
```

For example:

```shell
$ bash -c 'echo hello world | cat -e'
hello world$
$ ./minishell -c 'echo hello world | cat -e'
hello world$
```

Test:
```shell
make test
```


## Supported Features

Minishell is a miniature shell program based on Bash. Minishell supports:
* Prompt display
* Command history (up and down arrows)
* System executables available from the environment (`ls`, `cat`, `grep`, etc.)
* Local executables (`./minishell`)
* Builtin commands :
  * `echo`: display a line of text. (and option `-n`: do not output the trailing newline (no mostrar la última línea).)
  * `cd`: change the working directory (with only a relative or absolute path)
  * `pwd`: print name of current/working directory (no options)
  * `export`: set the export attribute for variables (no options)
  * `unset`: unset values and attributes of variables and functions (no options)
  * `env`:run a program in a modified environment (no options or arguments)
  * `exit`: cause the shell to exit (with exit number but no other options) 
* Pipes `|` which redirect output from one command to input for the next
* Redirections:
  * `>` redirects output
  * `>>` redirects output in append mode
  * `<` redirects input
  * `<< DELIMITER` displays a new prompt, reads user input until reaching `DELIMITER`, redirects user input to command input (does not update history)
* Environment variables (i.e. `$USER` or `$VAR`) that expand to their values.
  * `$?` expands to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.
* User keyboard signals:
  * `ctrl-c` displays a new prompt line.
  * `ctrl-d` exits minishell
  * `ctrl-\` does nothing

However, Minishell does not support `\`, `;`, `&&`, `||`, or wildcards.

# Concepts

<b>Bash</b> is the shell, or command language interpreter, for the gnu operating system.

A Unix <b>shell</b> is both a command interpreter and a programming language.

## chapter 2_ Bash Reference Manual:

- <b>control operator</b>: A <b>token</b> that performs a control function. It is a newline or one of the following: ‘||’, ‘&&’, ‘&’, ‘;’, ‘;;’, ‘;&’, ‘;;&’, ‘|’, ‘|&’, ‘(’, or ‘)’.

  * <b>token</b>: A sequence of characters considered a single unit by the shell. It is either a word or an operator.

      * <b>operator</b>: A control operator or a redirection operator. See Section 3.6 page 38, for a list of redirection operators. Operators contain at least one unquoted metacharacter.
          * <b>metacharacter</b>: A character that, when unquoted, separates words. A metacharacter is a space, tab, newline, or one of the following characters: ‘|’, ‘&’, ‘;’, ‘(’, ‘)’, ‘<’, or ‘>’.
      * <b>word</b>:  A sequence of characters treated as a unit by the shell. Words may not include unquoted metacharacters.


      [see <b>token</b> PART](https://medium.com/@dkwok94/how-a-shell-works-what-happens-when-ls-l-is-typed-df4eb468a030#:~:text=The%20shell%20tokenizes%20the%20string%20command%20entered%20by%20the%20user&text=A%20token%20is%20an%20element,each%20token%20is%20one%20word): 

    Typically, this is done using a getline() function which saves the user-entered line from STDIN into a buffer, including the newline character. A token is an element between a delimiter. In this case, the delimiter is typically a space character such that each token is one word. The delimiters are replaced with a \0 null byte so that each token is its own string. So for instance, for `ls -l`, `ls` is a token, and `-l` is another token because they are separated by spaces and each token ends with a null byte. These tokens are typically stored in an array of strings with a terminating NULL pointer for accurate parsing.

    The shell checks if the first token (the main command itself) is an alias, and if so, replaces the alias with the actual command. The shell will typically look in its system files for defined aliases. If the `ls` command is an alias for something else, the shell will replace the ls token with the string for the command that ls represents so that the correct operation takes place in the subsequent steps.

    The shell checks if the entered command matches any of the built-ins. Built-ins are commands that are explicitly coded into the shell itself. The actual code is not from an executable, but actually exists in the source code of the shell. Examples include `exit`, `cd`, and `env`. Since `ls` does not match any built-ins, it must be an executable. 

    When the command does not match any built-ins, the shell then implements the $PATH variable. 
    The $PATH variable is basically a list of directories that the shell looks through for executables. The shell picks this specific variable from the environment variable and uses the : as a delimiter to split the variable up into tokens. The way we did this in our shell was split the environment variable up into a singly linked list.

    The shell appends the command entered to the end of each directory and checks if the executable exists. If the executable does not exist in any $PATH directories, an error is thrown.

    The shell then goes through each directory in the $PATH variable and appends the `ls` command to the end of them. For example, the first directory is `/usr/local/sbin`, so the shell will combine this directory with `ls` to create the following: `/usr/local/sbin/ls` . The shell then puts this string into functions called `access()` (with an argument `F_OK`) or `stat()` which returns 0V if the file exists and `-1` if the file does not. The shell would then check if the file it found is an executable using `access()` with a `X_OK` argument. If the file does not exist or is not executable, it moves to the next directory and does the same thing. If it reaches the end of the $PATH variable, this means the executable does not exist and an error is thrown.

     When the executable is found, the parent process is then forked to create a child process. The child process executes the command while the parent process waits for it to finish. 
     If the executable is found, the shell goes into an execution function. The concept of child and parent processes is then used. The following three commands are most important for this:

    - fork()

    - wait()

    - execve()

    After running a command, the shell executes any shutdown commands programmed into it, frees any allocated memory from its operations, and re-prompts the user for input.


## chapter 3_: Basic Shell Features

When the shell reads input, it proceeds through a sequence of operations. If the input indicates the beginning of a comment, the shell ignores the comment symbol (‘#’), and the rest of that line.

Otherwise, roughly speaking, the shell reads its input and divides the input into words and operators, employing the quoting rules to select which meanings to assign various words and characters.

The shell then parses these tokens into commands and other constructs, removes the special meaning of certain words or characters, expands others, redirects input and output
as needed, executes the specified command, waits for the command’s exit status, and makes that exit status available for further inspection or processing.




### **Shell Command Analysis Process:** 

  * 1. **Reading Input**
  The shell reads input from the user (via standard input) or from a script file. 
  Reads its input from a file (see Section 3.8 [Shell Scripts], page 46), from a string supplied as an argument to the -c invocation option (see Section 6.1 [Invoking Bash], page 91), or from the user’s terminal.

  * 2. **Tokenization**
  Breaks the input into words and operators, obeying the quoting rules described in Section 3.1.2, page 6. These tokens are separated by metacharacters. Alias expansion is performed by this step (see Section 6.6, page 100).

      The input is broken down into **words and operators**, using whitespace and `metacharacters` as delimiters.
      
      
      Examples: see test/commands.txt


  * 3. **Parses the tokens**
  Parses the tokens into **simple** and **compound commands** (see Section 3.2 [Shell Commands], page 9). The shell constructs **commands and syntax structures**, interpreting **keywords**, **control structures**, and **operators**. In this part the pipes are processed: `|` 

      ```
      ls | grep ".txt"
      ```
      It becomes a pipeline of three commands, with the output of each passing to the next:
      ```
      ls (command)
      | (pipe operator)
      grep (command)
      ".txt" (argument, treated as a single token due to quotes)
      ```
        

  * 4. **Quoting and Expansion Handling**
  The shell processes quotes to determine which parts of the input should be treated as **literals**.  
  See Seccion 3.1.2 [Quoting], pages 6 - 9. Performs the various shell expansions (see Section 3.5 [Shell Expansions], page 24), breaking the expanded tokens into lists of filenames (see Section 3.5.8 [Filename Expansion], page 35) and commands and arguments.
  Then, various types of **expansions** take place, including:
        - **Variable expansion** (`$VAR` → its value)
        - **Tilde expansion** (`~` → home directory) 
 

  * 5. **Redirections Processing**
  The shell identifies and processes **input and output redirections**:
        - `< file` (input redirection)
        - `> file` (output redirection, overwrite)
        - `>> file` (output redirection, append)
        - `<<`

  * 6. **Command Execution**
  The shell executes the parsed command by:
        - Searching for the command in **built-ins** or the system’s **PATH**.
        - **Forking** a new process if necessary.
        - Executing the command using **exec()** system calls.

  * 7. **Waiting for Command Completion**
The shell waits for the command to finish execution, unless it is running in the **background** (`command &`).

  * 8. **Retrieving Exit Status**
  Once the command completes, the shell captures its **exit status**, which determines success (`0`) or failure (`>0`).

  * 9. **Making Exit Status Available**
  he exit status is stored in the special variable `$?`, allowing it to be checked or used in **conditional statements**.


### **Shell Error Handling Process**


  * 1. **Syntax Errors Detection**
        - The shell identifies **syntax errors** during the parsing phase.
        - Example: Missing quotes or unexpected tokens (`echo "Hello` → error: unexpected EOF).

  * 2. **Command Not Found**
        - If a command is not found in the **built-ins** or `PATH`, the shell returns an error.
        - Example: `unknowncommand` → `command not found`.

  * 3. **Permission Errors**
        - If the user does not have the required permissions to execute a file, the shell displays a permission error.
        - Example: `./script.sh` (without execute permissions) → `Permission denied`.

  * 4. **Redirection Failures**
        - Errors occur when input or output redirection fails, such as when a file does not exist.
        - Example: `cat < non_existent_file` → `No such file or directory`.

  * 5. **Exit Status Propagation**
        - Commands return an **exit status code** (`$?`) which indicates success (`0`) or failure (`>0`).
        - Example: `grep 'text' file.txt || echo "Error: text not found"`.

  * 6. **Signal Handling**
        - The shell detects **termination signals** (e.g., `SIGINT` for `Ctrl+C`) and handles them appropriately.
        - Example: Pressing `Ctrl+C` while running a command sends `SIGINT` to terminate it.

  * 7. **Handling Subshell and Pipelined Errors**
        - Errors in **subshells** or **pipelines** (`command1 | command2`) can be managed with `set -o pipefail`.
        - Example: `cat file.txt | nonexistentcommand` → Proper error propagation.

  * 8. **Custom Error Handling with Traps**
        - The `trap` command allows handling specific signals or errors.
        - Example: `trap 'echo "Error occurred!"' ERR`.

**Parses the tokens**

By using single quotes ('') you explicitly tell the shell not
to interfere with the string at all. If you use double quotes (""), some shell substitutions
do take place (variable, arithmetic, and tilde expansions and command substitutions),
but since we have none in this example, the shell has nothing to change.

```
You don't want the output to preserve your spacing
$ echo this was   very     widely     spaced
this was very widely spaced
$


You want the output to preserve your spacing.
$ echo "this was   very   widely        spaced"
this was   very   widely        spaced
$

or:

$ echo 'this   was very widely      spaced'
this   was very widely      spaced
$
```




```

```


```

```
